      I'm a software developer based in Dublin Ireland currently working with
      [Meg Support Tools](megit.com). My two passions are running and sea
      swimming, although that doesn't mean I'm any good at either!

    title: About
    content: >
      I grew up in Co. Cavan, and studied Business in Dublin City University.
      After graduating I followed the footsteps of my father and went into the
      electrical appliances industry, starting in July 2014 as a marketing
      assistant with [KAL](http://www.kal.ie/). Having spent two years with KAL,
      and then a further two with [Whirlpool](https://www.whirlpool.ie/) as a
      category manager, despite my relative career success I was deeply
      unsatisfied. I found no joy in my work and my future career path didn't
      fill me with excitement. Something needed to change.
