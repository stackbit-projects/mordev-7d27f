      I'm a software developer based in Dublin Ireland currently working with
      [Meg Support Tools](megit.com). My two passions are running and sea
      swimming, although that doesn't mean I'm any good at either!

    title: About
    content: "I grew up in Co. Cavan, and studied Business in Dublin City University. After graduating I followed in the footsteps of my [father](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaran-o-reilly-ab99a37b/) and went into the electrical appliances industry, starting in July 2014 as a marketing assistant with [KAL](http://www.kal.ie/). Having spent two years with KAL, and then a further two with [Whirlpool](https://www.whirlpool.ie/) as a category manager, despite my relative career success I was left feeling deeply unsatisfied. I found no joy in my work and my future career path had no appeal.\n\nSomething needed to change. In October 2018 I noticed a LinkedIn advert for the Udacity [Google Developers\_Challenge\_Scholarship](https://grow.google/programs/udacity/), a 3 month introductory program for people who wanted to learn software development. This set me on a new path of learning and discovery which allowed me to make the jump from marketing to software development, and in changing career, I also changed my life.\n"
